# 👋 Hi there,

I'm an applied scientist working at the intersection of **operations research and applied AI**, focused on building **decision-making systems that operate under real-world uncertainty**.

My work blends optimization, simulation, and learning to produce systems that are robust, interpretable, and deployable—not just benchmark-friendly.

Some of my old projects can be found at https://github.com/xiaoxuanh

## 🔍 What I Work On

- **Optimization & OR x AI**
  - Stochastic optimization, planning, and simulation
  - Decision-making under uncertainty
  - Hybrid OR + ML systems that combine optimization, learning, and heuristics

- **Multi-Agent Systems**
  - Designing end-to-end **Multi-Agent environments and simulators**
    - [InvestESG](https://github.com/yuanjiayiy/InvestESG): an environment studying how multiple AI agents behave and interact in a realistic and complex intertemporal social dilemma.
  - Modeling coordination, competition, **emergent behavior**, and ultimately **AI safety**
  - Studying system-level effects from agent interactions in shared environments

- **Applied AI**
  - Graph-based **knowledge retrieval**, particularly for code and structured reasoning
  - Deploying AI-based **workforce scheduling systems** and evaluating them against human-managed baselines
  - Building applied AI systems for **personal productivity**
    - [jobflow-ai](https://github.com/xiaoxuanhou/jobflow-ai): automated job search, resume tailoring, and LinkedIn outreach planning that can be executed on a daily basis.

## 🎯 What I Care About

- Practical impact over toy results  
- Robustness under noise, scale, and misspecification  
- Using AI to **augment human productivity** and **improve decision-making**
